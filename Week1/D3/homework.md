#HOMEWORK: MTA

There are 3 subway lines: 
 
**The N line has the following stops:**  
Times Square,   
34th,   
28th,  
23rd,  
Union Square,  
8th  
  
**The L line has the following stops:**  
8th,   
6th,  
Union Square,  
3rd,  
1st   

**The 6 line has the following stops:**  
Grand Central,   
33rd,  
28th,  
23rd,  
Union Square,  
Astor Place 

All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points.

(For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th stop on the 6 line.)

Your task is to write a Ruby program that will allow the user to calculate the length of its trip in the underground (i.e. the number of stops between any two given stations).
