##TRELLO

Earlier, today:

* we've learned about Agile Development
* this encourages feature-centric "sprints"
* we need a "task board" to track the status of features that we implement in our projects
* **Trello.com** offers a free project management tool → we'll get you signed up and show you the basics.

Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects and ideas into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

Alternatives to this are Pivotal tracker and Base Camp. These are project management tools which generally used in conjunction with:

This is a link to [the Trello development board](https://trello.com/b/nC8QJJoZ/trello-development), which is an excellent example on how to use Trello.
 
Trello is made up of a Board, lists and cards. Boards are made up of multiple lists. Lists contain cards. Cards represent the basic unit of a board, for instance: a new feature. Cards can move from list to list to indicate progression. Board members can add themselves to cards, start conversations on cards, create checklists on cards, and so on.

Remember: project management is a skill in its own right!

Effective devs manage their time effectively, and trello is a great way to do this. Trello is also a tool widely used in the real world, so the more comfortable you get with it, the better off you'll be.
 
Make sure to use it as much as possible for your homework and projects - it will help you keep track of your progress, your team's, and encourage you to manage and develop your app feature by feature.


**Getting started**

Sign up at [Trello.com](https://trello.com/)

Trello allows you to do the following:

* Create a board
* Invite people
  * you can invite other trello users to share your board
  * we can then assign users to cards
  * and we can subscribe to cards to see what changes others are making
  * best of all, we can collaborate on the board together
* Customise columns
* Add cards
* Move cards → we simply drag cards around to indicate their status
* Add labels [MoSCoW Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method)

Other customisation:

* due date:
  * each card can be given a due date
  * 3rd party apps can show these on a calendar view
* files → you can attach files e.g. under_construction.gif
* checklists → cards can have any number of checklists - yes todos in your todos!
