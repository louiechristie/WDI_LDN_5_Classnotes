##Introduction


In this lesson, we are going to see you how we can modify the gallery app, so that it stores the photos in the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

First, we need to sign up to AWS. Once we've done this, Amazon will give us a secret code that our app will have to use every time it talks to AWS.

This raises an interesting question: if we want to share our source code (e.g. on github) how can we do so without also sharing the secret credentials that our app relies on?

In answer to this question, we'll take a look at something called "environment variables", which provide a means of keeping secret things out of our code.


##Amazon Web Services


We have all undoubtedly heard of a little company called "Amazon". They are mainly in the business of:
  
- selling anything and everything online
- failing to deliver things on time when you pay extra for express delivery (true story)
- avoiding tax

In order to support their vast selling and tax-avoidance empire, Amazon found it necessary to build lots of computing infrastructure. 

Because Amazon sees huge peaks and troughs in traffic on their website, they don't need all of their computing infrastructure all the time, and so they decided to rent it out to other developers. 

This is what "Amazon Web Services", or AWS, is → a website that lets us rent computer infrastructure from Amazon. 

This rented infrastructure is used by millions of companies now, and AWS has become one of Amazon's biggest business areas.


###Guided tour

In order to keep this manageable, they broke their various computer systems up into discrete services that just do one thing well. We're going to use just one of these services today: S3 (i.e. "Simple Storage Service"). 

Let's take a quick tour of their most useful services:  

- [Simple Storage Service](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fs3%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHdWyob_qESgHcoPkhUD9uhksc3Lw) (S3) - a huge folder for storing your files in
- [Elastic Compute Cloud](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fec2%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGdVfqGba8hJnfnihNs2-MtB2HynA) (EC2) - computers for running your website on
- [Mechanical Turk](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mturk.com%2Fmturk%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFNIcOeycOcmohJr_4pPkh18-YdSA) - an API for distributing work to real people


###Signing up

<http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>  
click "create free account"


We're going to give you $250 worth of credit on AWS, but you'll still need to provide them with credit/debit card details before you can use their services.  

- sign up to AWS if you haven't already
- you'll need a credit card (or a debit card from a credit card company e.g. Visa Debit card)
- once you've signed up, check your email for a message from Jon with a credit coupon code
- go to add payment method and redeem the voucher - you should now have $250 to spend on AWS services

Now we're signed up, we can get the credentials that our app needs in order to use AWS  

- go to "account/console" > "security credentials"
- read the message - we won't bother with "2 factor auth" right now
- expand the Access Keys section
- click on the "create new access key" button
- download the key file, and keep it somewhere safe
  - DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR CLASS WORK FOLDER OR ANY OTHER FOLDER YOU SHARE WITH OTHERS
  - suggestion: create a ".ec2" directory in your home folder and put it in there


###S3

Now we have our account, and the codes our app will use to access our account. Let's then sign up to use S3…

- go to "account/console" menu item and select "console"
- this shows all the services we can use
- select "S3"
- follow the instructions to enable our account to use S3
- Back in the AWS console, click on "S3" again
- we are now taken to a view that lets us manage our own personal S3 storage

We can think of S3 as a big bucket in the cloud, where you can dump all our files. Conveniently, AWS actually uses the term "bucket" too. 

You can create as many buckets as you like, but they must have a globally unique name, i.e. if any other S3 user has already used a bucket name, you won't be allowed to use that name.

Create a bucket now called "wdi-london-sep-2013-" e.g. "wdi-london-sep-2013-jon-c" is the one I've created. 

When asked what region, select "Ireland". Generally speaking, things will be faster if you choose a region closer to your users.

Click on your bucket, and you'll see that it is currently empty. 

You can use the interface to create a folder within your bucket e.g. "foo". You can also use the interface to delete it again. 

Note:  

- right click works in this interface
- Folders can have any name you want, it is only the bucket that must have a unique name


##CarrierWave + S3


Now that we have S3 set up, it's time to fix our gallery app so that it stores our pictures in the cloud. 

But why use S3 at all?  

- multi-server sites - copying images to each server’s public folder is difficult... and stupid
- security - letting users save files on our web server is dangerous
- storage limitations - our web server probably won't have much storage space

So how do we change our app to make it use the cloud…?

- - -

First, we need to install a gem that the CarrierWave gem needs in order to work with cloud services. 

This gem is called "fog", and it is a very powerful gem that abstracts away all the complexity of cloud services. 

It lets us switch between rival providers relatively easily. AWS is the biggest, but there are a growing number of alternatives out there.

So, let’s add the fog gem to our Gemfile and bundle install and rbenv rehash.  
`gem "fog", "~> 1.3.1"`

Now, we can go to "app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb". 

Change the `storage :file` line to `storage :fog`. 

Also, following advice in the CarrierWave README, add the following to your uploader:  
`  include CarrierWave::MimeTypes`  
`  process :set_content_type`

We're almost done - the only remaining thing to do is adding configuration info to our app, so that it can talk with AWS and use S3. 

- - -

For this, let's create an initializer in our "config/initializers folder", and call it "carrierwave.rb". 

The CarrierWave README on github gives us an example initialiser to get started with.

Copy and paste this into our new file, and trim it down to contain:

```
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.fog_credentials = {
    :provider  => 'AWS',  # required
    :aws_access_key_id  => '<your AWSAccessKeyId>',  # required
    :aws_secret_access_key  => '<your AWSSecretKey>',  # required
    :region => 'eu-west-1',  # optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'
  }
  config.fog_directory  = '<your bucket name>'  # required
  config.fog_public  = true  # optional, defaults to true
end
```

And we're done! 

- - -

We can now drop the db for the app, and recreate it. Then fire up an app server, create a new gallery and some paintings.

Notice anything different? The pictures are now processed and uploaded to S3. We can check the S3 console to confirm.


##Environment Variables


Our updated Gallery App is working fine, our boss is happy with the new S3 upload feature, and all is well with the world. 

All we need to do now is ask the CTO for the company AWS credentials, so we can change the CarrierWave initialiser to use them instead of our own personal credentials.

The CTO laughs in your face and walks off shaking his head.

Why? Because we NEVER add security information like passwords or AWS credentials to our source code. 

If we did, then anyone with access to the source code has the keys to the kingdom, and can thus cause all kinds of mischief, like stealing the company's AWS credentials and using the company credit card to fund their own startup! 

We need a way to enable lowly developers to be able to work with the code, without giving them the keys to the kingdom.

So how do we give our program the codes it needs without typing them in directly? One solution is to use "environment variables".

- - -

Before we look at environment variables, let's remind ourselves about plain old shell variables. 

Just like we can create variables in a pry/irb session, we can also create variables in a regular shell session:  
`$ my_var=99`  

To display the value of a variable, we use echo:  
`$ echo $my_var`  
`99`  

Note that we prefix the variable name with a dollar symbol when we want to recall them.

Environment variables are very similar to regular variables, but we create them using "export":  
`$ export MY_ENV_VAR=100`  
`$ echo $MY_ENV_VAR`  
`100`  

The difference between regular shell variables and environment variables is that whenever we launch a new program from the shell (e.g. our ruby program), it will inherit all the environment variables from the shell.

We can see all the current environment variables by simply typing "env" in the shell:

```
$ env
TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
SHELL=/bin/zsh
USER=jon
PATH=/Users/jon/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/libexec
LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
HOME=/Users/jon
LOGNAME=jon
MY_ENV_VAR=100
```

⇒ as we can see, there are lots of environment variables already. 

Any program we launch will have access to all of these and so our programs can find out all sorts of interesting things about the environment it is running in e.g.:  

- USER - the current user's name
- HOME - the user's home folder
- LANG - the language (and character encoding) the user is using
- PATH - a list of places to look for programs we try and run

Note: we also have access to the "MY_ENV_VAR" variable we just created.

We can verify that these variables are accessible to our programs by launching one. For instance, pry is a program. 

So let's launch pry and take a look...

The ruby ENV object is a hash-like object that gives us access to the environment variables that ruby has inherited from the shell it was launched in.

```
$ pry
> ENV
{"HOME"=>"/Users/jon",
 "LANG"=>"en_GB.UTF-8",
 "LOGNAME"=>"jon",
 "MY_ENV_VAR"=>"100",
 "PATH"=>
 ```
 
```
  "/Users/jon/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p247/bin:/usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/0.4.0/libexec:/Users/jon/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/libexec",
 "SHELL"=>"/bin/zsh",
 "USER"=>"jon"}
```

```
> ENV['MY_ENV_VAR']
"100"
```

We can verify that the regular shell variable "my_env" was not passed to pry:
`> ENV['my_var']`  
`nil`  

We can see that it is possible to pass information to our ruby programs using environment variables. We now have a way to pass our secret credentials into our program at runtime, rather than hard-coding them into our source code.

- - -

More specifically, we can add our AWS credentials as environment variables. 

However, we don't want to manually create these environment variables every time we launch our app, and so we can add the "export" commands to our shell's config file. 

That way, every new shell we launch will have these credentials available as environment variables. 

To do so, we can add the following to ~/.bashrc:  
`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AK9999999999999999999`  
`export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=p9pkzBevqrererereiu99sdfsadf99999`  
`export WDI_S3_BUCKET=wdi-london-sep-2013-jon-c`  

We need to create a new terminal window or run `$ source source ~/.bashrc` in order for those new settings to take effect. Verify that they are available in terminal before continuing.

Now we can change our carrier wave initialiser to make use of these new ENV variables:  

```
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.fog_credentials = {
    :provider  => 'AWS',  # required
    :aws_access_key_id  => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],  # required
    :aws_secret_access_key => ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],  # required
    :region  => 'eu-west-1',  # optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'
  }
  config.fog_directory  = ENV['WDI_S3_BUCKET']  # required
  config.fog_public  = true  # optional, defaults to true
end
```

Now we can restart the app, and the app still works as intended, but we no longer have secure info in our source code. The CTO will be happy.

####A note on Heroku and environment variables

We'll be using Heroku to deploy our apps (Gerry will teach more on this topic later this week). We can't edit our shell profile on Heroku, but they do provide us with a way to set environment variables, and the principle is the same.

IMPORTANT MESSAGE RE: AWS - if we forget to get rid of the content of the bucket, we actually will keep paying for it. Think of emptying it once you’re done with it!
